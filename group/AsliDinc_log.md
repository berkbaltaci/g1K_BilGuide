On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I took some online courses about using Android Studio and learned how to develop a simple Android application with Java.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I learned about the services we have to use in our application and how to integrate them such as Maps SDK and Google API.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week we divided into 3 groups as signing up/in part, game part and information part. Abdullah and I took the information part which we have the users select a building that they want to be directed to in the main campus. 

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week we created a simple select building interface and tried to use Google Maps and Directions API in our navigation activity. We could handle with tracking the user's current location on Google maps and drawing a route to the selected building. However, we realised that it is not quite possible for us to provide navigation with Google's API and we started to search for another open source maps SDK. We met with Mapbox which provide developers the services that we exactly need for our application. 

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week we completed our map activity by using Mapbox SDK. We linked the select building screen to the map navigation screen and successfully pass data from one activity to another. I am now trying to learn how to create an aesthetic and user friendly user interface with Adobe Xd in order to make our application also pleasing to the eye.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
This week I edited the user interface design of our application.
