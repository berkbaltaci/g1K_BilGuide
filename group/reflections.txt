REFLECTIONS

We learned how to design an android application, its design, and structure.
In addition, we have learned authentication and data storage via firebase, and maps via MapBox SDK. 
This project also improved our java knowledge because we learned a lot of new classes and methods. 
Therefore, BilGuide contributes to our programming and designing skills in a considerable extent.
Meeting via Zoom for working on the project was difficult. We would try to add Event Mode
If we had a chance to meet the university cafes face to face, we could have a deal for BilCoin activity
We spent almost 2 months. 
We had some difficulties because of current situation, but we managed to do a group work. We are very proud of our work.
