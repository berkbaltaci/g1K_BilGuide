On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 01.04.2020 ~
This week I learned how to make layout design in android and how to pass from one activity to another.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week we held a meeting in Zoom to determine the subgroups and I chose to be in game mode whose members are also Murat Furkan and Recep. 

### ~ 23.04.2020 ~
This week I made the first, third, and forth layout with my friends in game mode. I prepared some of questions about inside the buildings on campus. We determined that when the user gives wrong answer three times or correct answer at most 3 attempts, the balance he/she has will change accordingly and he/she is directed to another question. After 3 specific questions about the building are answered, balance page will be viewed.

### ~03.05.2020 ~
This week I learned how to get location permission from the user and trace user location along with determine the destination which is the building selected in previous layout. We as the group of game mode made the second layout which has a map by using MapBox. I also learned how to change spinner question to question and made necessary changes in the code. Some details will be reviewed and some buildings will be added to the game mode.
