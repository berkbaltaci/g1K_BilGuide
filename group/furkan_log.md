On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 01.04.2020 ~
This week I learned how to make layout design in android and how to pass from one activity to another.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week we held a meeting in Zoom to determine the subgroups and I chose to be in game mode whose members are also Murat Furkan and Recep. 

### ~ 23.04.2020 ~
This week I made the first, third, and forth layout with my friends in game mode. I prepared some of questions about inside the buildings on campus. We determined that when the user gives wrong answer three times or correct answer at most 3 attempts, the balance he/she has will change accordingly and he/she is directed to another question. After 3 specific questions about the building are answered, balance page will be viewed.

### ~03.05.2020 ~
This week I learned how to get location permission from the user and trace user location along with determine the destination which is the building selected in previous layout. We as the group of game mode made the second layout which has a map by using MapBox. I also learned how to change spinner question to question and made necessary changes in the code. Some details will be reviewed and some buildings will be added to the game mode.

### ~04.05.2020 ~
In this meeting, we as the group of game mode learnt how to determine the state of arrival to destination point which is a building name selected on previous page. We wrote necessary codes and we managed that when the user arrives at the destination point, then the app shows a message called "You have arrived!". Also, I arranged locations of gates of some buildings and added to the code.

### ~05.05.2020 ~
In this meeting, we as the group of game mode faced a problem, which is if the user is at the destination point when he/she opens the app, then he/she receives the message "You have arrived", however, if he/she starts at a different point and comes to the destination  point, then the message does not appear on the screen. Hence, we added a button named "check arrival" and a message called "Please press check arrival button when you arrives at the building". Thus, if the user arrives at the building and presses this button, the message "You have arrived!Discover the building!" appears on the screen and the button named "discover the building" is activated, if not, the message "You haven't arrived yet" appears and discovery button remains anavailable when he/she presses check arrival button. Also, I added locations of other buildings along with we determined the intervals of latitude and longitude of the buildings on campus to understand the state of arrival so we completed the mission of game mode except very few details to be reviewed before combining the codes with other groups. 

### ~06.05.2020 ~
We as the game mode group arranged some details in the code and we tested final version of game mode. It has worked properly so we have uploaded the codes to github so that we can merge all codes with the codes of other groups. Finally, we held an meeting via zoom and we have combined all codes.
