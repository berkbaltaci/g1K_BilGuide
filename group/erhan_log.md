On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I started to learn basics of Android Studio.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week we decided Berk and I will do entrance, login, signup and main menu pages.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~ 
This week I and Berk started our project part and also we had a zoom meeting at April 24th. We started learning Google Firebase but we had some problems. Our pages didn't work properly after applying Firebase.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I learn how to use Google Firebase appropriately in an app and worked out first page, sign up page, login page and firebase authorization system.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
Finally, we finished the project. This week, all groups came together and combined all of the parts. I and berk integrated the game mode and bilcoin activity part to the database. We encountered with some minor problems, but we solved them.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week we tested the project's functions. We detected some issues. For example, when the user log in, at the first time he press the infomode's go button, program is not working. I tried to solve it. UPDATE: We solved everything on our project. Now, it is completely working.
