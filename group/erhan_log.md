On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### 06.04.2020 - 12.04.2020
This week I started to learn basics of Android Studio.

### 13.04.2020 - 19.04.2020
This week we decided Berk and I will do entrance, login, signup and main menu pages.

### 20.04.2020 - 26.04.202
This week I and Berk started our project part and also we had a zoom meeting at April 24th. We started learning Google Firebase but we had some problems. Our pages didn't work properly after applying Firebase.

### 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020
This week I learn how to use Google Firebase appropriately in an app and worked out first page, sign up page, login page and firebase authorization system.
