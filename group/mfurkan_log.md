On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23 March 2020 ~
This week I met with my group members and prepared UI design and also prepared the UI design report.

### ~ 30 March 2020 ~
This week I have learned how to design an Android activity and also how to use and arrange java components such as TextView, Button etc. and worked on layouts

### ~ 6 April 2020 ~
This week I have learned how to make connection between 2 different Android activities and how to convert information from one to another.

### ~ 13 April 2020 ~
This week I had a meeting with my group members and we discussed how to deal with our project and then we decided to divide the team into 3 subgroups so that each group can do their best and focus on a specific part of the project. My group members (for now) are Recep Uysal and Furkan Turunç, and we will be working on Game Mode of our android application project.

### ~ 23 April 2020 ~
This week I had a meeting with my subgroup members (Furkan Turunç and Recep Uysal) and we have started to design our own part (Game Mod). We have 4 different screens in aplication for Game Mode and in the first screen (activity) we have prepared some questions to the user about one of Bilkent University's buildings (after the user answers that question, we then switch to the second screen) and in the screen, we will show a map where both the user's and the building's (we asked about) locations appear and we will expect the user to go there but we haven't started yet to design this map part because we haven't started to learn how to use a map in an adroid project. However, we have started to design the third screen of Game Mode and in this screen we ask specific questions about the building after the user arrive there. When the user arrive the building we will learn that using the user's location's coordinates and comparing them with the buildings coordinates. Here, after the user answers our specific questions, he will earn BilCoins. This week we have prepared some questions and prepared the first, the third and some initial part of the second screens of our application. 

### ~ 3 May 2020 ~
This week I have learned how to use Mapbox in Android Studio and how to get and show the current location of the user in a map activity in an android application. Also, I have learned how to put a location mark in a specific place using latitudes and longitudes of the location. Therefore, we prepared (with Furkan turunç and Recep Uysal) the second screen and we almost finished it, just a few editings we will be doing. Additionally, we have finished the fourth screen where we inform the user how much BilCoins he earned.

### ~ 7 May 2020 ~
This week with my subgroup members(Furkan Turunç and Recep Uysal) I finished game mode. We fixed some little problems about the arrival to the destination point. Also we started to combine all the subgroups' parts and except some little problems and details, we almost finished our android mobile application.
