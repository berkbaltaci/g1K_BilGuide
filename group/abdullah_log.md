On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements. NOTE: I recorded what I did weekly, so these things happened in 1 weeks. For example, in 13.04.2020 part, there are things that I did from 13th april to 20th april.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I started to learn android studio via an online android studio course. I learned the basic components of Android studio and preparing a simple application. Because Android Studio uses java for coding, it is very similar to java.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I continued learning Android Studio and developiing an application. I learned basics for map services and APIs.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week we did a group meeting and decided that if we divide our group into three parts, we can be more focused to our works. Then, we concluded that Aslı and I will do information mode. We started to determine our needs for information mode and map services.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, we did a Zoom meeting and we prepared information mode building selection screen in 3 hours. Then, we tried to find the best map API for our needs. I started to search how to get the current location of user, how to put location mark to specific location, and how to navigate the user from location to the point. At first we decided to use Google Maps API because finding sources for Google is easier than other maps services and Google used in 3/4 of android applications. However, Google did not meet our needs because it does not provide navigation.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week, Aslı and I continued serching for the best maps application, and we concluded that MapBox meets our needs. We did another Zoom meeting and we decided to learn MapBox coding until 29th April. Starting from 29th April, I did some applications of MapBox system during 3 days such as getting current location, directing routes from location to specific point etc. However, it was tiring because finding necessary resources for directing routes and navigation in MapBox was hard. Finally, we did completely working navigation activity in 4th May. We are able to get current location, direct routes from current location to specified point and navigate.
Also, I started to design our application's logo and icons.

### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
This week we did a meeting in order to we merged three parts. It was hard because even java files are different from each other; gradle,res and manifest files have the same name and merging these was not so easy. Also, I designed and added splash screen, which is screen that appears 3 seconds when the user enters the app, with my friends. In addition, I implemented the screen that counts from 3 before starting the game mode. Now, there are some minor bugs such what will be done when back pressed etc. Me and all group will try to solve them. UPDATE: Most of issues were solved.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week we tested the project's functions. We detected some issues. For example, when the user log in, at the first time he press the infomode's go button, program is not working. I tried to solve it. UPDATE: We solved everything on our project. Now, it is completely working.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
 This week, I finished designing the logo and icon, with my friends' opinions. I finalized it and added to the our application. We made the project demo video, and second version of detailed design report.
