On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I started to learn android studio via an online android studio course. I learned the basic components of Android studio and preparing a simple application. Because Android Studio uses java for coding, it is very similar to java.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I continued learning Android Studio and developiing an application. I learned basics for map services and APIs.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week we did a group meeting and decided that Aslı and I will do information mode. We started to do something individually.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, we did a Zoom meeting and we prepared information mode building selection screen in 3 hours. Then, we tried to find the best map API for our needs.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week, Aslı and I continued serching for the best maps application, and we concluded that MapBox meets our needs. We did another Zoom meeting and we decided to learn MapBox coding until 29th April. Starting from 29th April, we did some applications of MapBox system during 3 days such as getting current location, directing routes from location to specific point etc. However, it was tiring because finding necessary resources for directing routes and navigation in MapBox was hard. Finally, we did completely working navigation activity in 4th May. We are able to get current location, direct routes from current location to specified point and navigate.
