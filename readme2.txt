Project Name: BilGuide 
BilGuide is an application that helps you to discover Bilkent University and get routes.
In the main menu, you will see two modes. Game mode provides you to discover the main campus, and earn
BilCoins! Information mode helps you to go wherever you want inside the campus. Just log in and enjoy!

Softwares: We used Android Studio 3.6 and we compile it with JDK8 in the program. When we wanted to run the program
we created emulator to test our programs. Furthermore, we used different types of development kits such as MapBox Maps SDK for Android, Google Firebase API, GPS. 
We also created APK for our game to test applicability of BilGuide with our phones. 

Current status: It is almost done with the adjustments of interface. We have done entreance pages, game mode,
information mod and bilcoin activity mod for games we finished all the user designs for the modes.

Entrance Pages and Database ( Erhan Er, Berk Baltacı)

Although it seems like we allocated the classes among us, each group member contributed to all classes of their modes.

Erhan Er ( LoginActivity, User Profile, Bilcoin Activity,MainActivity)
 
I implemented the firebase authentication to the login and sign up pages.
In addition, I implemented realtime database system to the bilcoin activity and game mod balance pages.

Berk Baltacı ( SignupActivity, MainMenuActivity, LoginActivity)

I tried to make log in and sign up pages for their actions. 
Moreover, I focused on main menu page. 
In addition, I also tried to help Erhan for database issues.
